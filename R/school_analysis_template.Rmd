## Introduction

This analysis looks at all alumni and current parents of students in `r school_name`. The time period included is from `r format(as.Date(as.character(from), "%Y%m%d"),  "%B %d, %Y")` to `r format(as.Date(as.character(to), "%Y%m%d"),  "%B %d, %Y")`.

There are currently `r comma(n_distinct(school_prospects$entity_id))` alumni and current parents of students in `r school_name`, comprising `r comma(n_distinct(school_prospects$hh_id))` households.

## Demographics

`r percent(as.numeric(record_type[1,2]/n_distinct(school_prospects$entity_id)))` of alumni and current parents of students in `r school_name` have a record type of `r record_type[1,1]`, `r percent(as.numeric(record_type[2,2]/n_distinct(school_prospects$entity_id)))` have a record type of `r record_type[2,1]`, and `r percent(as.numeric(record_type[3,2]/n_distinct(school_prospects$entity_id)))` have a record type of `r record_type[3,1]`. Note that these percentages do not add up to 100% since each entity may have multiple record types.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
record_type %>%
  filter(record_type_desc %in% c("UCB Parent of Current Student", "Alum: Undergrad", "Alum: Grad")) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Record Type", "Entities*"),
        format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left") %>%
  footnote(symbol = "Each entity may have multiple record types"
)
```

Age has been determined by birth date if available and estimated by class year if not. Alumni are most likely to be `r arrange(top_n(age, 2), -entities)[1,1]` years old (`r percent(as.numeric(arrange(top_n(age, 2), -entities)[1,2]/sum(age$entities)))`), with the next most common age being `r arrange(top_n(age, 2), -entities)[2,1]` (`r percent(as.numeric(arrange(top_n(age, 2), -entities)[2,2]/sum(age$entities)))`).

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
age %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=decade, y=entities)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(rect = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  ylab(NULL) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  ggtitle("Entities by Age")
```

Most alumni are graduates of `r school[1,1]`, followed by `r school[2,1]` and `r school[3,1]`. The following table displays the top five schools represented.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
school %>%
    kable(col.names = c("School", "Entities"),
        format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left") 
```

## Ratings

`r percent(as.numeric(1-filter(rated, capacity_rating == "Not Rated")[1,3]/sum(rated$households)))` of `r school_name` households have been rated. Of those, `r percent(as.numeric(sum(filter(rated, capacity_rating_code %in% c(1:9))$households)/sum(filter(rated, capacity_rating_code %in% c(1:14))$households)))` are rated 250K+ or higher.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
rated %>%
  filter(capacity_rating != "Not Rated") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(capacity_rating, capacity_rating_code), y=households)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(rect = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  ylab(NULL) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  ggtitle("Households by Capacity Rating")

```

The following table looks at the breakdown of each capacity rating by Major Gift Score.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
capacity_mgs_table %>%
  kable(format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left") %>%
  add_header_above(header = c(" " = 1, "Major Gift Score" = 6))

```

For unrated households only, the following table looks at the breakdown of Implied Capacity Score and Major Gift Score.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
ics_mgs_table %>%
  kable(format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left") %>%
  add_header_above(header = c(" " = 1, "Major Gift Score" = 6))

```

## Events

There have been `r comma(n_distinct(events$activity_code))` events attended by `r school_name` households between `r format(as.Date(as.character(from), "%Y%m%d"),  "%B %d, %Y")` and `r format(as.Date(as.character(to), "%Y%m%d"),  "%B %d, %Y")`. `r arrange(top_n(summarise(group_by(events, unit_code_desc), households = n_distinct(hh_id), events = n_distinct(activity_code)), 5, wt=events), -events)[1,1]` has held the most events, followed by `r arrange(top_n(summarise(group_by(events, unit_code_desc), households = n_distinct(hh_id), events = n_distinct(activity_code)), 5, wt=events), -events)[2,1]`.

## Visits

There have been `r comma(n_distinct(visits$report_id))` visits to `r school_name` households between `r format(as.Date(as.character(from), "%Y%m%d"),  "%B %d, %Y")` and `r format(as.Date(as.character(to), "%Y%m%d"),  "%B %d, %Y")`. `r arrange(top_n(summarise(group_by(visits, unit_desc), households = n_distinct(hh_id), visits = n_distinct(report_id)), 5, wt=visits), -visits)[1,1]` has made the most visits, followed by `r arrange(top_n(summarise(group_by(visits, unit_desc), households = n_distinct(hh_id), visits = n_distinct(report_id)), 5, wt=visits), -visits)[2,1]`.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
visits %>%
  group_by(fiscal_year) %>%
  summarise(households = n_distinct(hh_id), visits = n_distinct(report_id)) %>%
      kable(col.names = c("Fiscal Year", "Households", "Visits")) %>%

## Proposals and Asks 

There have been `r comma(n_distinct(proposals$proposal_id))` proposals involving `r school_name` households between `r format(as.Date(as.character(from), "%Y%m%d"),  "%B %d, %Y")` and `r format(as.Date(as.character(to), "%Y%m%d"),  "%B %d, %Y")`. `r arrange(top_n(summarise(group_by(proposals, unit), households = n_distinct(hh_id), proposals = n_distinct(proposal_id)), 5, wt=proposals), -proposals)[1,1]` has the most assignments, followed by `r arrange(top_n(summarise(group_by(proposals, unit), households = n_distinct(hh_id), proposals = n_distinct(proposal_id)), 5, wt=proposals), -proposals)[2,1]`.
